* 📍 Details below:

** (1) Invitation Sizes (Formal Sizes)

The vendor provides standard envelopes, so we recommend designing based on their standard sizes.
Below are the basic formats. If you have a special layout or need a template from the vendor, please let us know!

- 👉 *Standard Invitation:*

Folded: 26 x 19.2 cm

Postcard: 13.1 x 19.2 cm

- 👉 Square Invitation:

Folded: 29 x 14.5 cm

Postcard: 14.5 x 14.5 cm

👉 Long Invitation:

Postcard: 21 x 9 cm

** (2) Paper Options (Textures)

- 👉 *Watercolor Paper (300 gsm):*
Has irregular texture like watercolor paper. Strong ink absorption and elegant finish — gives a refined artistic look.

- 👉 Pearlescent Paper (300 gsm):
Silver-white color with metallic shine. Creates luxurious tones under different light, classic and elegant. Requires longer drying time.

- 👉 Ivory Paper (300 gsm):
Soft white tone with visible fibers. Rough in appearance but smooth and firm to the touch. Absorbs ink very well, resulting in richer colors.

- 👉 Linen Paper (280 gsm):
Fine cross-embossed texture, good ink absorption, pleasant tactile quality.

🐰 If you’d like to see the textures in person, you can schedule a time with 仨樓 to check the paper samples and confirm details before deciding.

** (3) File Format Requirements

If you’re using professional design software like Illustrator (AI) or Photoshop (PSD),
please make sure your file and format settings follow the specifications below.
Color mode must be CMYK, 300 dpi.

- 👉 AI files:

Vendor uses CS6, so please save to this version or lower.

Text must be outlined, and photos embedded.

Do not lock layers or objects.

Include bleed (0.2 cm on all sides).

Artboard size = final file size (no extra margins needed).

- 👉 PSD files:

Merge layers or flatten image.

Include 0.2 cm bleed on all sides (no need to extend further).

- 👉 PDF files:

Double-check that dimensions and object placements are correct.

Before converting, make sure fonts are outlined, images are embedded, and no layers are locked.

** (4) File Notes

- 👉 Keep all text, elements, and borders at least 0.8 cm away from edges to avoid being trimmed or leaving uneven borders.
All file sizes already include 0.2 cm bleed on all sides — no need to extend further.

- 👉 For example: if your invitation is 13.1 x 19.2 cm, design it exactly at that size, with bleed included. (Artboard = final file size.)

- 👉 Do not include bleed lines in the file — trimming is done manually and not perfectly precise. Including bleed lines may cause unwanted black edges.

- 👉 Both thank-you cards and invitations must use CMYK color mode.
This is very important — the vendor will not convert color modes, as CMYK and RGB have different color ranges.
Please note that printed colors may slightly differ from screen display; exact color matching is not possible.

- 👉 For any post-processing files (such as foil stamping, UV coating, etc.), you must provide separate layer files with perfectly aligned positions.
The vendor will not adjust or verify alignment.

- 👉 Post-processing layers must be in 100% K black (CMYK mode required).
Make sure it’s set correctly — otherwise, it won’t be recognized as K100%.
